# Reference Materials

This directory contains reference materials, architectural diagrams, code snippets, and implementation guides that can be used as inspiration or templates when implementing features in the Ghost Protocol project.

## Contents

- **AI Models**: Reference implementations for various AI models and integrations
- **Architecture Diagrams**: System architecture and component relationships
- **Database Functions**: SQL functions and database schema references
- **Memory Services**: Implementation guides for memory-aware components
- **Tool Orchestration**: Patterns for tool integration and authentication

## Usage

These files are meant to be used as reference only and should not be directly included in the main codebase. They provide patterns, architectural guidance, and implementation details that can be adapted to the specific needs of the project.

## Important Note

The content in this directory is not directly used by the application but serves as documentation and reference material for developers. The actual implementation in the main codebase may differ from these reference files.

If you're looking for the actual implementation, please refer to the main source code in the `/src` and `/supabase` directories.
