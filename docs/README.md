# SD-Ghost-Protocol Documentation

This directory contains documentation and reference materials for the SD-Ghost-Protocol project.

## Directory Structure

- `/reference`: Contains reference materials, architectural diagrams, code snippets, and implementation guides that were previously in the "Ghost protocol missing files" folder. These files provide patterns and inspiration for implementation but are not directly used in the application.

## Important Note

The "Ghost protocol missing files" folder at the root of the project is a legacy folder that has been migrated to `/docs/reference`. It is included in `.gitignore` and should not be used or committed to version control. All reference materials should be accessed from `/docs/reference` instead.

This organization helps keep the project structure clean and prevents confusion between reference materials and actual implementation code.

## Usage

When implementing new features or exploring the project architecture, refer to the materials in the `/reference` directory for guidance and patterns. However, always adapt these references to match the specific needs and conventions of the current codebase.

For actual implementation code, refer to the `/src` and `/supabase` directories in the project root.
