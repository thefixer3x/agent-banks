## 💡 CUSTOMER CONVERSATION SCRIPTS

Imagine having a professional AI presenter creating daily content about your products/services. Would you be interested in a 15-minute demo?"*

Your AI avatar can create product demos, customer testimonials, daily tips, and promotional content automatically. This typically saves businesses 10+ hours per week and increases social media engagement by 50%+."*
