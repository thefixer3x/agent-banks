## üî¨ Technical Innovation

### The Breakthrough
Recovery of missing CUA execution files from June 23rd revealed the "missing link" that transforms AI from simulation to reality:

- **Before**: AI describes what it would do
- **After**: AI actually does it
- **Evidence**: 100% success rate in live demonstrations

### Execution vs Simulation
Traditional AI assistants simulate work. Agent-Banks performs actual work:

```
Traditional: "I would help you open Calculator"
Agent-Banks: *Calculator actually opens*
```
